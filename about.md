My name is Jason Kwan. I am currently an Information and Technology Systems major enrolled at The University of Texas at Dallas. I plan on graduating in the Spring of 2020. I am currently employed at Frisco Wholesale Lumber as the IT manager as well, and have been in this position for over 3 years now. Post graduation, I plan on utilizing the knowledge I gained from school and from my work experience as an IT manager and going into the field of database administration.

## Why website building
I first though of this idea when we had a project in Business Communications that required us to create a personalized website. I didn't want to do anything too conventional, and I didn't like the limitations that comes with using the free versions of wix and weebly. Therefore, I decided to code a website myself. This was my first website ever built from the ground up. I've used weebly before to make the website for the company I work at, but I thought it'd be more fun to try something more different. The benefit of completely coding it from the ground up is the fact that there is near unlimited customization and the fact that there are no watermarks on my website.

## What did I learn
Within the span of a little less than a week, I learned the HTML language used to code it, using linux and github to publish it, and managed to build this very website. I think it turned out well, given that it looks no different from an ordinary website which is all I could really ask for for a first time website. I learned a lot about the inner workings of making a good website, and realize I still have a long way to go when it comes to web development.

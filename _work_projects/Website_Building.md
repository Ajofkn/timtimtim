# Why website building
This was my first website ever built from the ground up. I've used weebly before to make the website for the company I work at, but I thought it'd be more fun to try something more different. It certainly does look different given that there is no mark at the top or bottom of the screen saying it is powered by a different website, giving it an unprofessional look. 

# What did I learn
Within the span of a little less than a week, I learned the language and managed to build this very website. It looks and feels about as fleshed out as a normal website. I learned a lot about the inner workings of making a good website, and realize I still have some short comings when it comes to artistic talent.

## Building lots of Computers
Building computers really started out as an interest for me when I graduated high school. I wanted a powerful computer, and realized how limiting it was to buy one that was prebuilt. Therefore, I took it upon myself to build one of my own. I gained a lot of knowledge in the hardware and inner workings of a computer through that, and I managed to get my foot in the door as an IT manager for my current employment.  

At my current job, I've done hardware maintenance for computers. From swapping faulting parts inside a computer to building them from scratch. Some are for day to day usage, some are for personal and home usage, and some are also for architects to use for drawing homes. I've also built many for friends and family members who are looking for a cheaper option for computers. I have a range of experience building different types of computers to suit the needs of those who use it on the daily.

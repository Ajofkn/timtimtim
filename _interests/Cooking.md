## Why I love it  
One of my favorite things to do is cooking. What I love about cooking is the fact that there are so many different techniques that can be done to the same ingredient that can create vastly different products. Take an egg for example. You can fry it, you can scramble it, you can make an omlette, but you can also create eggs benedict by poaching an egg and making hollandaise sauce by emulsifying the yolk with butter, or make mayonnaise with yolks and an oil. Techniques and food science in general is a fascinating study when looking into what sort of things go together to produce what sort of outcome. The trial and error of having to go through different ingredients to test what tastes good together, although not as impressive as inventing new technology, is about as rewarding.  

## What I like to make
Generally, I like to make an easy to make dish. I've been playing around with sous vide, and am really liking the outcome compared to making it normally. So steaks and chickens done sous vide, and then grilled on the griddle and then pan frying some greens on the fond is currently my go-to. If there's something I don't know or would like to learn how to make, I generally use SeriousEats as my reference. [Link](https://www.seriouseats.com)

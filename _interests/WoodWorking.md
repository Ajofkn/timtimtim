# Woodworking  
Woodworking is one of my favorite hands on activity. It combines wood into usable items, and makes things really cost efficient. There is nothing more satisfying than looking at a completely handmade product. It's also enjoyable putting it all together. I generally use Autocad to model the pieces before I cut them out, so there aren't too many.  

The two piece at the top are ones that I use daily. The first one is an elevated angled table. It was suppose to be a set piece, the second being similar in design but with a big opening in the middle with plexi-glass over the hole and a light underneath so that it could make paper see through. Both pieces are supposed to be used in tandem for architecture work and was suppose to be a gift, but unfortunately only the plexi-glass one was taken leaving this one to sit all by itself.  

The second one is a bench. This one was one of my first works, so its really rough and not very well made. Truthfully, it serves more as a wooden coat rack more than anything else.  

I was never really interested in woodworking up until recently, when a random woodworking Youtuber was recommended to me. It was a video on woodworking and the techniques and work involved in making wooden pieces. It's a very beginner friendly website for those who want to learn the steps.
